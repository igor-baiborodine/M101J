Please use the Enron dataset you imported for the previous problem.
For this question you will use the aggregation framework to figure
out pairs of people that tend to communicate a lot. To do this, you
will need to unwind the To list for each message.

This problem is a little tricky because a recipient may appear more
than once in the To list for a message. You will need to fix that in
a stage of the aggregation before doing your grouping and counting of
(sender, recipient) pairs.

Query:
db.messages.aggregate([
	{"$unwind" : "$headers.To"},

	{
		"$group" : {
			"_id" : {
				"_id" : "$_id",
				"from" : "$headers.From"
			},
			"to" : {"$addToSet" : "$headers.To"}
		}
	},

	{"$unwind" : "$to"},

	{
		"$group" : {
			"_id" : {
				"from" : "$_id.from",
				"to" : "$to"
			},
			"count_msg" : {
				"$sum" : 1
			}
		}
	},

	{ "$sort" : {"count_msg" : -1} },

	{ "$limit" : 5 }
])
